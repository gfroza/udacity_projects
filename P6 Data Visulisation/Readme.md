Summary

I was interested in finding out the following regarding the Titantic disaster:

1) What was the split between adult genders (male and female)?
2) Were women more likely to survive than men?
3) Were first class passengers more likely to survive than other class passengers?

I wanted to create a data visualisation which enabled me to answer all the above questions.

Design

I used a stacked bar chart to answer my questions. I wanted to be able to flick between Sex and Passenger Class so I used buttons from the D3.js library. I wanted to chart all passengers and not just survivors as I wanted to see the likelihood of survival relative to all passengers.

For Sex:
I grouped the passengers by male or female and then used a stacked bar to show the split between perished and survived.

For Passenger Class:
I grouped the passengers by 1st, 2nd or 3rd class and then used a stacked bar to show the split between perished and survived.
